	into the dark, and there they are:<br>
	Centaurs, half in and half out of the woods,<br>
	hindquarters still trees.
	Downstairs in dreams I look<br>
	directly into their man-eyes,<br>
	which are opaque, absorbent.<br></p>

	<h2><del>They don’t speak.</del></h2>
	<p>I don’t speak<br>
	of the long yellow teeth tearing off<br>
	the little dress—just for a glimpse,<br>
	no harm done. <em>No hands, no harm.</em><br>
	Their hindquarters still trees.<br>
	No words to explain or contain it.<br>
	You can’t translate something<br>
	that was never in a language<br>
	in the first place.</p>
